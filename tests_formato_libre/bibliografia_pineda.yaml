  abstract: 'It is commonly thought that a state-dependent quantity, after being
    averaged over a classical ensemble of random Hamiltonians, will always become
    independent of the state. We point out that this is in general incorrect: if the
    ensemble of Hamiltonians is time-reversal invariant, and the quantity involves
    the state in higher than bilinear order, then we show that the quantity is only
    a constant over the orbits of the invariance group on the Hilbert space. Examples
    include fidelity and decoherence in appropriate models.'

  title: A random matrix theory of decoherence
  container-title: New J. Phys.
  page: '115016'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Random matrix theory is used to represent generic loss of coherence of
    a fixed central system coupled to a quantum-chaotic environment, represented by
    a random matrix ensemble, via random interactions. We study the average density
    matrix arising from the ensemble induced, in contrast to previous studies where
    the average values of purity, concurrence and entropy were considered; we further
    discuss when one or the other approach is relevant. The two approaches agree in
    the limit of large environments. Analytic results for the average density matrix
    and its purity are presented in linear response approximation. The two-qubit system
    is analysed, mainly numerically, in more detail.

  title: Quantum non-markovian behavior at the chaos border
  container-title: J. Phys. A
  page: '115301'
  volume: '47'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: In this work we study the non-Markovian behavior of a qubit coupled to
    an environment in which the corresponding classical dynamics change from integrable
    to chaotic. We show that in the transition region, where the dynamics has both
    regular islands and chaotic areas, the average non-Markovian behavior is enhanced
    to values even larger than those in the regular regime. This effect can be related
    to the non-Markovian behavior as a function of the initial state of the environment,
    where maxima are attained at the regions dividing separate areas in classical
    phase space, particularly at the borders between chaotic and regular regions.
    Moreover, we show that the fluctuations of the fidelity of the environment—which
    determine the non-Markovianity measure—give a precise image of the classical phase
    portrait.

  abstract: '&lt;p&gt;Statistical studies of languages have focused on the rank-frequency
    distribution of words. Instead, we introduce here a measure of how word ranks
    change in time and call this distribution &lt;italic&gt;rank diversity&lt;/italic&gt;.
    We calculate this diversity for books published in six European languages since
    1800, and find that it follows a universal lognormal distribution. Based on the
    mean and standard deviation associated with the lognormal distribution, we define
    three different word regimes of languages: “heads” consist of words which almost
    do not change their rank in time, “bodies” are words of general use, while “tails”
    are comprised by context-specific words and vary their rank considerably in time.
    The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified by linguists
    for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk model which reproduces
    the rank variation of words in time and thus the diversity. Rank diversity of
    words can be understood as the result of random variations in rank, where the
    size of the variation depends on the rank itself. We find that the core size is
    similar for all languages studied.&lt;/p&gt;'
